# The Abide Project
The Abide Project is a Bible reading tracker with a goal of getting more people engaged with the word of God.

## Project Goals
- Allow users to add Bibles to their Collection, or Library
- Allow users to keep track of current reading plans and reading progress for each of their Bibles
- Allow users to see a github like heat map for chapters read, across all Bibles and for individual ones
- Allow users to have and update travel logs for each of their Bibles

### Dashboard
The dashboard will be the main page with a high level overview of everything going on. This will have the following things being displayed to the user upon logging in:
- Map showing all the places the user has traveled to with their bibles along with ability to filter it to only show locations of specific bibles
- Heat map with history of chapters read, again with ability to filter based on specific bible or all
- Bible Shelf:
- - The Bible Shelf is going to be a quick overview of the Bibles in a users Library. This will show a card like presentation for each bible with the date added, total number of read throughs, and percentage of current read through done. This will also have an option to go directly to that bibles plan to update the current read through

### Library
This is the page where all of the updating and adding of Bibles, reading plans, and adding of travel log entries will take place. It will have a full list of all the Bibles in a user's collection with full details about each one. Upon clicking on one of the entries, it will bring up another screen that will allow them to view the details for the specific bible, mark off read chapters in the current read through, and add or update entries in the travel log.
